iNTRUDER - pentest_tools.py API ReferenceThis document provides a reference for the core functions within the pentest_tools.py module. This module is the operational core of the iNTRUDER platform, responsible for all direct interaction with system hardware and command-line penetration testing tools.Core Wireless FunctionsThese functions manage the state of the wireless network interface.get_wireless_interfaces()Description: Scans the system using iw dev to find all available wireless network interfaces.Parameters: None.Returns: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an interface. Example: [{'name': 'wlan0'}, {'name': 'wlan1'}]enable_monitor_mode(interface)Description: Takes control of a specified network interface, spoofs its MAC address for anonymity, and puts it into monitor mode.Parameters:interface (str): The name of the interface to modify (e.g., 'wlan0').Returns: A dictionary indicating success or failure. Example: {'success': True, 'interface': 'wlan0'}disable_monitor_mode(mon_interface)Description: Takes an interface out of monitor mode, restores its original permanent MAC address, and returns it to a standard 'managed' state.Parameters:mon_interface (str): The name of the interface currently in monitor mode.Returns: A dictionary indicating success. Example: {'success': True}Offensive CapabilitiesThese are generator functions that execute long-running attack or capture processes and yield real-time status updates.capture_handshake(interface, bssid, channel, essid)Description: Runs airodump-ng to focus on a specific target and capture a WPA/WPA2 4-way handshake.Parameters:interface (str): The name of the interface in monitor mode.bssid (str): The BSSID of the target access point.channel (str/int): The channel the target is operating on.essid (str): The ESSID of the target, used for filename generation.Yields: Dictionaries with status updates, including a handshake_captured event on success.capture_pmkid(interface, bssid, essid, channel)Description: Executes hcxdumptool to attempt a modern PMKID capture against a target AP. This is often faster than waiting for a handshake.Parameters: Same as capture_handshake.Yields: Dictionaries with status updates, including a pmkid_captured event on success.deauth_attack(interface, bssid, client, count)Description: Runs aireplay-ng to send deauthentication packets, forcing clients to disconnect from a target AP.Parameters:interface (str): The name of the interface in monitor mode.bssid (str): The BSSID of the target access point.client (str): The MAC address of the client to deauthenticate (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff for broadcast).count (str/int): The number of deauth packets to send.Yields: Raw output lines from the aireplay-ng process.crack_handshake(file_path, wordlist)Description: Uses aircrack-ng to perform an offline dictionary attack against a captured handshake file (.cap).Parameters:file_path (str): The absolute path to the .cap file.wordlist (str): The absolute path to the wordlist file to use for the attack.Yields: Dictionaries with status updates, including a password_found event on success.
